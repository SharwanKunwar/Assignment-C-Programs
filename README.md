## ❓ What is Programming?

**Definition:**  
Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written in a programming language to solve problems or perform tasks.

**Example:**  
Creating a calculator app, developing a game, or writing a program to display your name.

## ❓ What is C?

**Definition:**  
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1972** at Bell Labs. It is a procedural language and is widely used for system programming, developing operating systems, and embedded systems.

---

## 🧰 Uses of C

- Operating system development (e.g., Linux)
- Embedded systems
- Game development
- Compilers and interpreters
- Database systems
- Desktop applications
- Network drivers

---

## 💡 Why Learn C?

- It's the **foundation** for many other programming languages like C++, Java, and Python.
- Helps understand **low-level memory management**.
- Teaches **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**.
- Used in **competitive programming** and technical interviews.

---

## 🌟 Features of C

- Simple and easy to learn
- Fast and efficient
- Procedural language
- Rich set of built-in operators and functions
- Portability (Write once, compile anywhere)
- Low-level memory access using pointers

---

## 🏗️ Structure of a C Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // code block
    return 0;
}
```

**Components:**
- Preprocessor Directive (`#include`)
- `main()` function
- Statements inside `{ }`
- `return 0;` indicates successful program execution

---

## 📝 Basic Syntax

- Every statement ends with a **semicolon** `;`
- Curly braces `{}` are used to group statements
- Case-sensitive language
- `main()` is the starting point of execution

---

## 👋 Hello World Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```
